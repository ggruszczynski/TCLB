he error you're encountering, [libx264 @ 0x640c54a6ff00] height not divisible by 2 (2902x825), indicates that the resolution of your input images (or the resolution you're attempting to encode at) has a height that is not divisible by 2. The H.264 codec, which is being used here (-c:v libx264), requires that both the width and height of the video be divisible by 2.
